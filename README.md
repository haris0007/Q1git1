## Q1

1. Given an array of numbers, use map() to create a new array that contains the squares of each number. Input: [2, 3, 4, 5] Expected Output: [4, 9, 16, 25]
2. Given an array of numbers, use filter() to return an array of only even numbers. Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Expected Output: [2, 4, 6]
3. Given an array of numbers, use reduce() to calculate the sum of all elements. Input: [5, 10, 15, 20] Expected Output: 50
4. Given an array of numbers, first filter out the odd numbers, then square the remaining numbers, and finally, calculate the sum of the squared numbers using filter(), map(), and reduce(). Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Expected Output: 20 Explanation: Filtered even numbers: [2, 4], squared: [4, 16], sum: 20
